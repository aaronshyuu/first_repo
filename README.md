# NBA Data Science Project

## Description
As one of the most popular sports in the world, basketball offers entertainment and business opportunities. The NBA, arguably the top basketball league in the world, is watched by millions of people around the world. In order to satisfy fans and increase business growth, teams are constantly acquiring better players and coaches. Ultimately, every team has the same goal of making it to the finals and winning a championship. Knowing that 30 teams occupy the NBA, it is extremely challenging to reach the playoffs and all teams try to find an advantage through analytics.

## Goal
As I am passionate about basketball and follow the Portland Trail Blazers closely as a fan so I have decided to focus on stats of NBA players in my project. With performence and salary data for players in the 2018 season, I will analyze various correlations and check my hypothesis. Furthermore, I will be breaking down player statistics with regression analysis and using prediction study techniques to predict salary.

## Questions & Hypothesis
Does age have an impact on performence? My hypothesis is that offensive and defensive production will clearly drop off as players age. (ie. there is negative correlation between age and both offensive and defensive stats) Also, salary would increase as players get older in the NBA. This means that there is a positive correlation between salary and player's age. I also believe that Points per game and Age are good predictors for salary of players.
